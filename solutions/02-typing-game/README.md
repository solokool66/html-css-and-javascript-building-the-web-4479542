## 1: Explain HTML code

```bash
look at the code in the index.html file I have open.

Create two markdown tables - each with name, description, usage as the 3 columns.

In table 1: identify the key HTML concepts used in the file in terms of high-level structural elements e.g., headings, lists etc. Put the name in column 1, a short description of the concept in column 2 and the specific example of its usage in column 3.

In table 2: Identify the HTML elements used in this file as concepts. Repeat the same exercise as before in terms of providing name, description and usage example.

In both cases, use beginner-friendly language suitable for a high-school audience and write with a clear and concise tone that focuses on a learner audience

```

### Table 1: Key HTML Concepts

| Name          | Description                                                                 | Usage Example                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| Language Attribute | Specifies the primary language of the document's content.                   | `<html lang="en">`                             |
| Headings      | Used to define headings in an HTML document, important for structure.       | `<h1>Practice your typing</h1>`                |
| Paragraphs    | Defines a paragraph of text, useful for breaking up content into readable sections. | `<p id="quote"></p>`                           |
| Divisions     | Used to divide or section off parts of a webpage for styling or scripting.  | `<div>Click start to have a quote displayed...</div>` |
| Input Fields  | Allows users to enter data. Used for forms, data entry, and interactive elements. | `<input type="text" aria-label="current word" id="typed-value" />` |

### Table 2: HTML Elements Used

| Name          | Description                                                                 | Usage Example                                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `<!DOCTYPE>`  | Tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in.        | `<!DOCTYPE html>`                              |
| `<html>`      | The root element of an HTML page.                                          | `<html lang="en">`                             |

| `<meta>`      | Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character set.          | `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`                     |
| `<title>`     | Sets the title of the document, shown in the browser's title bar or tab.   | `<title>Typing</title>`                        |
| `<link>`      | Used to link external resources like CSS files to the HTML document.       | `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />` |
| `<body>`      | Represents the content of an HTML document. Contains everything shown on the page. | `<body>...</body>`                             |
| `<h1>`        | Represents a top-level heading in the document.                           | `<h1>Practice your typing</h1>`                |
| `<div>`       | Used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.                      | `<div>Click start to have a quote displayed...</div>` |
| `<p>`         | Defines a paragraph.                                                       | `<p id="quote"></p>`                           |
| `<input>`     | Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms.                   | `<input type="text" aria-label="current word" id="typed-value" />` |

## 2: Explain CSS code

```bash
look at the code in the style.css file I have open.

Create two markdown tables - each with name, description, usage as the 3 columns.

In table 1: identify the key CSS concepts used in the file in terms of high-level topics like classes, inheritance, cascading stylesheets, layouts etc.. Put the name in column 1, a short description of the concept in column 2 and the specific example of its usage in column 3.

In table 2: Identify the CSS properties used in this file as concepts. Repeat the same exercise as before in terms of providing name, description and usage example.

In both cases, use beginner-friendly language suitable for a high-school audience and write with a clear and concise tone that focuses on a learner audience

```

## 3: Explain JS code

```bash
look at the code in the script.js file I have open.

Create two markdown tables - each with name, description, usage as the 3 columns.

In table 1: identify the key JS concepts used in the file in terms of high-level topics like functions, arrays, variables etc.. Put the name in column 1, a short description of the concept in column 2 and the specific example of its usage in column 3.

In table 2: Identify key functional aspects of the application enabled by JS. Repeat the same exercise as before in terms of providing name, description and usage example.

In both cases, use beginner-friendly language suitable for a high-school audience and write with a clear and concise tone that focuses on a learner audience

## 4: Explain the overall project 

```bash
Look at 3 files from the typing game application folder - index.html, script.js and style.css - which are currenty open in the editor pane.

Can you briefly explain what this application is and how it is being built. The explanation should use informal language suitable for a high school audience. Be clear and concise in your explanations and capture the explanation in a bulleted list of points. End with a suggested list of meta-prompts a learner can ask, to dive deeper into the project.
```

Given the context from the [`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F05-app-dev%2Ftyping-game%2Findex.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/webdev-with-copilot/transcripts/05-app-dev/typing-game/index.html") excerpt and assuming typical roles for `script.js` and `style.css` in a web application, here's a breakdown suitable for a high school audience:

- **index.html**: This is your webpage's foundation. It's like the stage where your typing game will play out. It includes:
  - A title that shows up in the browser tab.
  - A link to the `style.css` file, which is like the director of how everything looks.
  - Instructions to click start and type a quote as fast as possible.
  - An input box for typing the quote and paragraphs (`<p>`) for displaying the quote and messages.

- **style.css**: This file is all about making your webpage look cool. It's like the costume designer for your game, deciding how everything on your stage (the [`index.html`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F05-app-dev%2Ftyping-game%2Findex.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/webdev-with-copilot/transcripts/05-app-dev/typing-game/index.html")) looks. It controls:
  - The size and color of your text.
  - The layout of your game, like where the quote and input box sit on the page.
  - Any cool visual effects, like shadows or animations when you type correctly or incorrectly.

- **script.js**: This is where the action happens. It's like the brain of your game, controlling how everything works. It probably does things like:
  - Picking a random quote for you to type.
  - Checking if what you're typing matches the quote.
  - Giving you feedback, like "Great job!" or "Try again!", based on your typing accuracy and speed.

### Meta-prompts for deeper learning:
- How can I add more quotes to the game in `script.js`?
- What CSS tricks can I use in `style.css` to make the game more visually appealing?
- Can I modify `script.js` to add levels of difficulty to the game?
- How can I use JavaScript to track and display typing speed in real-time?
- Is it possible to save high scores locally on the user's computer or on a server?
