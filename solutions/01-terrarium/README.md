## 1: Explain HTML code

```bash
look at the code in the index.html file I have open.

Create two markdown tables - each with name, description, usage as the 3 columns.

In table 1: identify the key HTML concepts used in the file in terms of high-level structural elements e.g., headings, lists etc. Put the name in column 1, a short description of the concept in column 2 and the specific example of its usage in column 3.

In table 2: Identify the HTML elements used in this file as concepts. Repeat the same exercise as before in terms of providing name, description and usage example.

In both cases, use beginner-friendly language suitable for a high-school audience and write with a clear and concise tone that focuses on a learner audience

```

### Table 1: Key HTML Concepts

| Name  |Description                                                                 | Usage Example                                  |

| `<meta>`      | Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character set and viewport settings. | `<meta charset="utf-8" />`                     |
| `<link>`      | Used to link external resources like CSS files to the HTML document.        | `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />` |
| `<script>`    | Embeds or references JavaScript code in the HTML document.                  | `<script src="./script.js" defer></script>`    |
| `<body>`      | Represents the content of an HTML document. Content inside this tag is shown in the browser. | `<body>` section with the webpage's content.   |
| `<div>`       | A generic container for flow content, used for styling and layout purposes. | `<div id="page">` as the main content wrapper. |
| `<h1>`        | Represents the highest level heading in the document.                       | `<h1>My Terrarium</h1>` for the main title.    |

## 3: Explain JS code

```bash
look at the code in the script.js file I have open.

Create two markdown tables - each with name, description, usage as the 3 columns.

In table 1: identify the key JS concepts used in the file in terms of high-level topics like functions, arrays, variables etc.. Put the name in column 1, a short description of the concept in column 2 and the specific example of its usage in column 3.

In table 2: Identify key functional aspects of the application enabled by JS. Repeat the same exercise as before in terms of providing name, description and usage example.

In both cases, use beginner-friendly language suitable for a high-school audience and write with a clear and concise tone that focuses on a learner audience

## 4: Explain the overall project 

```bash
Looking at the index.html , style.css and script.js files can you briefly explain what this application is and how it is being built. The explanation should use informal language suitable for a high school audience. Be clear and concise in your explanations and capture the explanation in a bulleted list of points. End with a suggested list of meta-prompts a learner can ask, to dive deeper into the project.
```

Sure, let's break down what this application might be about and how it's being built, using the snippet from [`style.css`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/webdev-with-copilot/transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css") and imagining what could be in `index.html` and `script.js`:

- **The Basics:**
  - The application seems to be a web page, given the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - HTML (`index.html`) is likely setting up the structure of the page, like the skeleton of a body.
  - CSS ([`style.css`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/webdev-with-copilot/transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css"), the part you showed) is making the page look nice, like choosing the outfit for the skeleton.
  - JavaScript (`script.js`) probably adds interactivity, like making the skeleton dance when you click a button.

- **Style Details:**
  - The CSS snippet shows styles for the body, headings ([`h1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css")), and some specific sections ([`#left-container`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css"), [`#right-container`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css"), [`.container`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css"), [`.plant-holder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css"), [`.plant`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A32%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css")).
  - It sets up a basic font, centers the main heading, and uses colors and positioning to layout parts of the page.
  - There are containers set to be on the left and right sides, and something called a "plant-holder" which suggests this might be a gardening or plant-themed app.

- **Functionality Guess:**
  - Given the names, this app might let users interact with plants in some way, maybe placing them in containers or something similar.
  - The JavaScript file is likely used to handle these interactions, like dragging a plant image into a container.

- **Learning Points:**
  - How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build a web page.
  - The use of CSS for styling and layout, including positioning elements on the page.
  - The concept of responsiveness and interactivity added by JavaScript.

**Suggested Meta-Prompts for Learners:**
- "How does the `index.html` structure support the CSS styles defined?"
- "What JavaScript functions might be used to make the plants draggable?"
- "Can you explain how CSS positioning works, using [`#left-container`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css") and [`#right-container`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css") as examples?"
- "What are some ways to make the web page responsive on different devices?"
- "How can we add more interactivity to the app, like saving a layout of plants?"
