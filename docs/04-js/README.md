# 01 - Understanding Variables

Welcome back! In this lesson, we will learn about variables. Variables are fundamental in any programming language, including JavaScript. They are containers that hold data values, which can be numbers, text, or even more complex data.

Think of a variable as a box that you can store things in. You can put a value in the box, take it out, or change it whenever you need to. In JavaScript, we use the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords to declare a variable.

For our draggable terrarium, we need to keep track of the position of our elements as they are being dragged. We will use variables to store these positions.

Open your `script.js` file. At the top of the file, we will declare four variables using the `let` keyword. These variables will store the initial and current positions of the mouse cursor. Add the following code to your `script.js` file:

```javascript
let pos1 = 0,
  pos2 = 0,
  pos3 = 0,
  pos4 = 0;
```

Here’s what each variable represents:

- `pos1` and `pos2` will store the change in cursor position on the X and Y axis.
- `pos3` and `pos4` will store the current cursor position on the X and Y axis.

By setting these variables to 0 initially, we ensure they have a defined value before we start using them to track positions.

Let’s save our `script.js` file. Your code should now look like this:

```javascript
let pos1 = 0,
  pos2 = 0,
  pos3 = 0,
  pos4 = 0;
```

In this lesson, we introduced variables, which are essential for storing and manipulating data in JavaScript. We declared four variables that will help us track the position of our elements while they are being dragged.

Understanding variables is crucial because they allow us to store and work with data dynamically. In the next lesson, we’ll learn about functions and how they can perform tasks for us in JavaScript. See you then!

# 02 - Creating Functions

Welcome back! Today, we’re going to talk about functions in JavaScript. Functions are one of the most important concepts in programming. They allow us to group a set of instructions into a single unit that can be executed whenever we need it.

Think of a function as a recipe. The recipe contains all the steps you need to follow to make a dish. Instead of writing out the steps every time you want to make the dish, you just refer to the recipe. Similarly, instead of writing the same code multiple times, you write a function and call it whenever you need it.

Let’s create a function in our `script.js` file that will handle the dragging of our elements.

Open your `script.js` file. Below our variable declarations, we’ll add a new function called `dragElement`. This function will take an HTML element as an argument and make it draggable. Here’s how to declare the function:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
}
```

The `function` keyword is used to declare a function in JavaScript. The name of our function is `dragElement`, and it takes one parameter called `terrariumElement`. This parameter represents the HTML element that we want to make draggable.

Inside the function, we re-declare our position variables to ensure they are scoped correctly within the function. This is important for tracking the position of the element during the drag operation.

Save your `script.js` file. Your code should now look like this:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
}
```


In this lesson, we introduced functions, which allow us to group a set of instructions into a single unit that can be executed whenever we need it. We created a function called `dragElement` that will eventually handle the dragging of our terrarium elements.

Understanding functions is crucial because they help us organize our code and make it more reusable. In the next lesson, we’ll learn about manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. See you soon!

# 03 - Manipulating the DOM

Welcome back! Today, we’re going to learn about manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. The DOM, or Document Object Model, represents the structure of our webpage as a tree of objects. JavaScript allows us to interact with the DOM, making our webpages dynamic and interactive.

In this lesson, we’ll use JavaScript to select our plant elements by their ID so we can make them draggable.

Open your `script.js` file. Below our `dragElement` function, we’ll use the `document.getElementById` method to select our plant elements. This method returns the HTML element with the specified ID.

Let’s start by selecting the element with the ID `plant1` and call the `dragElement` function:

```javascript
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant1"));
```

We’ll also select the element with the ID `plant2`:

```javascript
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant2"));
```

Save your `script.js` file. Your code should now look like this:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
}

dragElement(document.getElementById("plant1"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant2"));
```

In this lesson, we learned about manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. We used the `document.getElementById` method to select our plant elements by their ID and called the `dragElement` function to make them draggable.

Understanding how to manipulate the DOM is essential for creating dynamic and interactive webpages. In the next lesson, we’ll learn about event handling and how to respond to user actions. Stay tuned!

# 04 - Event Handling

Welcome back! Today, we’re going to learn about event handling in JavaScript. Event handling allows us to listen for and respond to user actions like clicks, drags, and more. This is a key part of making our webpage interactive.

In this lesson, we’ll add event listeners to our plant elements to handle the drag event. We’ll update our `script.js` file to listen for when the user clicks on a plant element and starts dragging it.

Open your `script.js` file. Inside the `dragElement` function, we’ll add an event listener for the `pointerdown` event. This event is triggered when the user presses a pointer button, like a mouse click, on the element.

Let’s add the event listener inside the `dragElement` function:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
  terrariumElement.onpointerdown = pointerDrag;
}
```

The `onpointerdown` property is set to our `pointerDrag` function, which we’ll define next. This function will handle the initial actions when the user starts dragging the element.

Next, let’s add the `pointerDrag` function inside the `dragElement` function:

```javascript
function pointerDrag(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(e);
  pos3 = e.clientX;
  pos4 = e.clientY;
  document.onpointermove = elementDrag;
  document.onpointerup = stopElementDrag;
}
```

The `pointerDrag` function takes an event object `e` as its parameter. The `e.preventDefault()` method prevents any default actions that might occur when the event is triggered. The `console.log(e)` statement logs the event object to the console, which is useful for debugging.

Now, let’s update our code to include the `elementDrag` and `stopElementDrag` functions:

```javascript
function elementDrag(e) {
  pos1 = pos3 - e.clientX;
  pos2 = pos4 - e.clientY;
  pos3 = e.clientX;
  pos4 = e.clientY;
  terrariumElement.style.top = terrariumElement.offsetTop - pos2 + "px";
  terrariumElement.style.left = terrariumElement.offsetLeft - pos1 + "px";
}

function stopElementDrag() {
  document.onpointerup = null;
  document.onpointermove = null;
}
```

Save your `script.js` file. Your code should now look like this:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
  terrariumElement.onpointerdown = pointerDrag;

  function pointerDrag(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(e);
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;

    document.onpointermove = elementDrag;
    document.onpointerup = stopElementDrag;
  }

  function elementDrag(e) {
    pos1 = pos3 - e.clientX;
    pos2 = pos4 - e.clientY;
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;
    terrariumElement.style.top = terrariumElement.offsetTop - pos2 + "px";
    terrariumElement.style.left = terrariumElement.offsetLeft - pos1 + "px";
  }

  function stopElementDrag() {
    document.onpointerup = null;
    document.onpointermove = null;
  }
}

dragElement(document.getElementById("plant1"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant2"));
```

In this lesson, we learned about event handling and added event listeners to our plant elements. This allows us to respond to user actions like clicks and drags.

Understanding event handling is crucial for creating interactive webpages. In the next lesson, we’ll review what we’ve learned and finalize the draggable elements functionality. See you soon!

## 05 - Understanding Closures

Welcome back! Today, we’re going to learn about closures in JavaScript. Closures are a powerful feature that allow an inner function to access variables from its outer function. This is especially useful for managing state and keeping track of data over time.

In our draggable terrarium, we need to track the position of the mouse and the element while it’s being dragged. We’ll use closures to do this.

Open your `script.js` file. Inside the `dragElement` function, we’ll add more code to the `pointerDrag` function to update the mouse position when the user starts dragging the element.

Here’s how we’ll do it:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
  terrariumElement.onpointerdown = pointerDrag;

  function pointerDrag(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;
    document.onpointermove = elementDrag;
    document.onpointerup = stopElementDrag;
  }

  function elementDrag(e) {
    pos1 = pos3 - e.clientX;
    pos2 = pos4 - e.clientY;
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;
    terrariumElement.style.top = terrariumElement.offsetTop - pos2 + "px";
    terrariumElement.style.left = terrariumElement.offsetLeft - pos1 + "px";
  }

  function stopElementDrag() {
    document.onpointerup = null;
    document.onpointermove = null;
  }
}
```

The `pointerDrag` function now updates `pos3` and `pos4` to the current position of the mouse cursor. It also sets up event listeners for the `pointermove` and `pointerup` events. These events will be handled by the `elementDrag` and `stopElementDrag` functions, which we’ve already defined.

Next, we’ll ensure that our plant elements are draggable by calling the `dragElement` function for each plant element:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
  terrariumElement.onpointerdown = pointerDrag;

  function pointerDrag(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(e);
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;
    document.onpointermove = elementDrag;
    document.onpointerup = stopElementDrag;
  }

  function elementDrag(e) {
    pos1 = pos3 - e.clientX;
    pos2 = pos4 - e.clientY;
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;

    terrariumElement.style.top = terrariumElement.offsetTop - pos2 + "px";
    terrariumElement.style.left = terrariumElement.offsetLeft - pos1 + "px";
  }

  function stopElementDrag() {
    document.onpointerup = null;
    document.onpointermove = null;
  }
}

dragElement(document.getElementById("plant1"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant2"));
```

# 06 - Putting It All Together

Welcome to the final lesson! Today, we will review what we’ve learned and finalize the draggable elements functionality. We’ve covered variables, functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling. Now, let’s ensure that all our plant elements are draggable.

First, let’s make sure we call the `dragElement` function for each plant element. We will add calls to `dragElement` for all plant elements by their IDs.

Open your `script.js` file and add the following lines:

```javascript
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant1"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant2"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant3"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant4"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant5"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant6"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant7"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant8"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant9"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant10"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant11"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant12"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant13"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant14"));
```

Save your `script.js` file. Your final code should look like this:

```javascript
function dragElement(terrariumElement) {
  let pos1 = 0,
    pos2 = 0,
    pos3 = 0,
    pos4 = 0;
  terrariumElement.onpointerdown = pointerDrag;

  function pointerDrag(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(e);
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;
    document.onpointermove = elementDrag;
    document.onpointerup = stopElementDrag;
  }

  function elementDrag(e) {
    pos1 = pos3 - e.clientX;
    pos2 = pos4 - e.clientY;
    pos3 = e.clientX;
    pos4 = e.clientY;
    terrariumElement.style.top = terrariumElement.offsetTop - pos2 + "px";
    terrariumElement.style.left = terrariumElement.offsetLeft - pos1 + "px";
  }

  function stopElementDrag() {
    document.onpointerup = null;
    document.onpointermove = null;
  }
}

dragElement(document.getElementById("plant1"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant2"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant3"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant4"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant5"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant6"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant7"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant8"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant9"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant10"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant11"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant12"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant13"));
dragElement(document.getElementById("plant14"));
```

In this final lesson, we reviewed the key concepts we’ve learned throughout this series and ensured that all our plant elements are draggable.

Let’s recap:

- We learned about variables and how they store data.
- We created functions to group our code into reusable blocks.
- We manipulated the DOM to interact with our HTML elements.
- We handled events to respond to user actions.
- We used closures to maintain access to important variables, enabling our drag-and-drop functionality to work correctly by keeping track of the mouse and element positions even after the initial function has executed.

By combining all these concepts, we created a dynamic and interactive virtual terrarium where the plants can be dragged around the screen.

Thank you for following along with this series. Keep practicing and exploring more about JavaScript to enhance your web development skills. Happy coding!
